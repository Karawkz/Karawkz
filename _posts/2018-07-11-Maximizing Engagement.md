## Goals
At the end of week 1 at Metis, we did a group project to explore how a charity that supports women in tech could for its annual summer gala maximize event exposure, attendance and donations through **outreach** at various MTA stations in New York.

## Approach
To find out which stations the charity should focus most of its resources (i.e. street team deployment) on, we decided to target stations with the *most traffic*, especially that of individuals a) in the tech sector, b) interested in the tech sector or c) most likely to donate.

## Data and Assumptions

### Stations with Most Traffic

**Data**. We used MTA turnstile data and focused on the mean exits per hour per station. 

**Assumptions**. Given that the gala would take place during Summer, we decided to analyse data from the *last 3 years during the Summer period (May to July)*. As we wish to target the working crowd, our focus was on *weekdays during work hours from 6am to 8pm*. Below is a map of some of the stations with the most traffic; the larger the labels, the greater the traffic.
