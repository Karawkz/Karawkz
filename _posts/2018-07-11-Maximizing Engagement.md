## Goals
At the end of week 1 at Metis, we did a group project to explore how a charity that supports women in tech could for its annual gala maximize event exposure, attendance and donations through **outreach** at various MTA stations in New York.

## Approach
To find out which stations the charity should focus most of its resources (i.e. street team deployment) on, we decided to target stations with the *most traffic*, especially that of individuals a) in the tech sector, b) interested in the tech sector or c) most likely to donate.
