Test: dear blog, please work.

I joined the Metis Summer 2018 San Francisco Data Science bootcamp on the 2nd of July.

Prior to this, I was working in the public sector in international trade, representing Singapore in trade negotiations. I studied Economics at the National University of Singapore and after doing the Machine Learning by Andrew Ng course on Coursera, I realised that the Econometrics concepts I had learnt and enjoyed in university were very pertinent (and actually handy beyond the academic realm) to the Machine Learning methods employed today.

This ignited my interest in data science, and I subsequently completed a number of relevant MOOCs out of interest despite my work schedule, which required me to travel frequently and combat jetlag. 

I spoke to a few data scientists, some of whom were in research. I found what they were doing really inspiring and impactful. I then decided to try and make a career switch when I realised I was beginning to fall in love with the quantitative aspects of data science and the potential to work on projects that improve the way things work.

It is only week 2 but so far, Metis has been a wonderful and intense experience - I am picking up many things very quickly, or at least I am expected to do so, and my fellow coursemates are very bright, positive and motivated folk.

I am glad that this blog is working despite the cheesiness overload of my first post.
