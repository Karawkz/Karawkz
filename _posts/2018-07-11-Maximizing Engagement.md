## Goals
At the end of week 1 at Metis, we did a group project to explore how a charity that supports women in tech could for its annual summer gala maximize event exposure, attendance and donations through **outreach** at various MTA stations in New York.

## Approach
To find out which stations the charity should focus most of its resources (i.e. street team deployment) on, we decided to target stations with the *most traffic*, especially that of individuals a) in the tech sector, b) interested in the tech sector or c) most likely to donate.

## Data and Assumptions

### Stations with Most Traffic

**Data**. We used MTA turnstile data and focused on the mean exits per hour per station. 

**Assumptions**. Given that the gala would take place during Summer, we decided to analyse data from the *last 3 years during the Summer period (May to July)*. As we wish to target the working crowd, our focus was on *weekdays during work hours from 6am to 8pm*. 

**Outcomes.** Below is a map of some of the stations with the most traffic; the larger the labels, the greater the traffic.

### Individuals in Tech or Interested in Tech

**Data**. We used 2 data sets from Google Maps API and MeetUp API to identify locations. 

**Assumptions**. As proxies of tech interest, we focused on areas with the greatest number of tech companies and schools as well as upcoming MeetUp tech events during the Summer. The idea is that people who are already in the tech industry or are interested in tech events would more likely be interested in coming to a tech gala.

**Outcomes**. After using Google Maps API to map addresses to their zip codes, we found that the zip codes of Manhattan and specifically Silicon Alley had the most tech interest.

### Most Likely to Donate

**Data**. We found housing prices from the New York Government Rolling Sales data.
